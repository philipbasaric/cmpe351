This metric is the same for both GAAP and non-GAAP presentations. For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company expects licensing billings to be between $61 million and $67 million. The Company also expects royalty revenue to be between $12 million and $18 million, product revenue to be between $18 million and $24 million and contract and other revenue to be between $9 million and $15 million.

The Company also expects operating costs and expenses to be between $71 million and $67 million. Additionally, the Company expects non-GAAP operating costs and expenses to be between $59 million and $55 million.

Conference Call Rambus management will discuss the results of the quarter during a conference call scheduled for 2:00pm PT today.

Non-GAAP Financial Information In the commentary set forth above and in the financial statements included in this earnings release, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures:operating expenses and interest and other income (expense), net.In computing each of these non-GAAP financial measures, the following items were considered as discussed below: stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and retention bonus expense, restructuring charges, impairment (recovery) of assets held for sale, amortization expense, non-cash interest expense and certain other one-time adjustments. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate for both its own assessment of, and to show investors, how the Company's performance compares to other periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the financial statements contained in this release. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: Stock-based compensation expense. These expenses primarily relate to employee stock options, employee stock purchase plans, and employee non-vested equity stock and non-vested stock units. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because such expenses are non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Additionally, given the fact that other companies may grant different amounts and types of equity awards and may use different option valuation assumptions, excluding stock-based compensation expense permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's results with peer companies. Acquisition-related costs and retention bonus expense. These expenses include all direct costs of certain acquisitions and the reported periods' portion of any retention bonus expense associated with the acquisitions. The Company excludes these expenses in order to provide better comparability between periods as they are related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the Company's operations. Restructuring charges.These charges may consist of severance, contractual retention payments, exit costs and other charges and are excluded because such charges are not directly related to ongoing business results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. Impairment (recovery) of assets held for sale.These charges consist of non-cash charges (recoveries) to assets held for sale and are excluded because such charges are non-recurring and do not reduce the Company's liquidity. Amortization expense. The Company incurs expenses for the amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. The Company excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Company's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company's core business. Non-cash interest expense on convertible notes. The Company incurs non-cash interest expense related to its convertible notes. The Company excludes non-cash interest expense related to its convertible notes to provide more accurate comparisons of the Company's results with other peer companies and to more accurately reflect the Company's ongoing operations. Income tax adjustments. For purposes of internal forecasting, planning and analyzing future periods that assume net income from operations, the Company estimates a fixed, long-term projected tax rate of approximately 24 percent for both 2020 and 2019, which consists of estimated U.S. federal and state tax rates, and excludes tax rates associated with certain items such as withholding tax, tax credits, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the release of any deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Accordingly, the Company has applied these tax rates to its non-GAAP financial results for all periods in the relevant years to assist the Company's planning. On occasion in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies that the Company may exclude in deriving its non-GAAP financial measures if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.

            "BATTLE CREEK, Mich., Nov. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --Roughly 300 million children have been without school meals and are at risk of hunger since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Food banks are working to prevent the health crisis from becoming a hunger crisis, but their resources can only go so far. Lisa Moon, CEO of The Global FoodBanking Network and Stephanie Slingerland, Kellogg Company Sr. Director of Philanthropy and Social Impact share how school-based feeding programs can help fill that feeding gap. Social K Kellogg Company BlogBy:Lisa Moon, CEO of The Global FoodBanking Network and Stephanie Slingerland, Kellogg Company Sr. Director of Philanthropy and Social Impact The Global FoodBanking Network (GFN) recently release Healthy Nations Start with Healthy Children A View from the Field1. Commissioned in 2019, the study evaluated just how much GFN's member food banks help their communities. According to the study, food banks in 30 countries serve an estimated 3.49 million school-age children. Even before COVID, an estimated 73 million vulnerable children were not being reached with food at school. That number has no doubt risen and will continue to rise without urgent action by government, the private sector, and civil society. Without intervention, childhood hunger can have devastating effects, like damaging a child's physical and cognitive development with consequences that may last a lifetime if not addressed. This not only threatens a child's future, but also harms families, communities, and nations' economic growth. The study's results prove that school-based feeding programs are among the most cost-effective means of addressing child hunger. Programs Needed to Drive Greater ImpactKellogg has been a founding partner of GFN, which has a shared mission of helping to end childhood hunger. GFN food banks serve as a lifeline for children. The food banks provide school breakfasts, school lunches, backpacks or weekend take-home rations, summer or holiday food rations, and nutrition monitoring and education. More programs like these are essential to avoid an even greater hunger crisis. We must take action now in two main ways: Strengthen government social support systems through school meals. The public and private sectors should make critical investments in school-based feeding programs as a means of promoting a society's educational, employment and economic success. Strengthen the role of food banks and other private-sector actors. Food banks can support the ongoing development of food aid to vulnerable populations and can help secure public investments in social protection, health, education and economic development. There's an urgent need to act now. Many models for successful school-based programs exist and, when scaled, the potential to quickly and efficiently reach vulnerable children is huge. For example, since 2013, FoodForward South Africa (FFSA) has partnered with Kellogg's South Africa to provide breakfast for thousands of children each school day. In 2019, FFSA distributed breakfast to primary and secondary schools in areas of high poverty and unemployment in Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg, and Port Elizabeth, serving 30,035 students daily. Established in 2001 with 17 schools, Foodbank Western Australia developed the first School Breakfast Program run by a food bank in the GFN Network. By 2019, 490 schools participated in the program. The program directly reached over 21,500 children, serving more than 69,900 breakfasts each week. We Must Act NowThese are real examples of why we believe governments, and food and beverage companies including manufacturers and retailers can be instrumental to providing healthy surplus food to food banks. Governments can also sponsor policies that encourage food donations, which would engage the private sector to support government programs and invest in school meals. We understand these entities have a lot on their plates right now. But millions of kids do not. We must act now. Please help us help more kids by donating to The Global FoodBanking Network. About Kellogg CompanyAt Kellogg Company (NYSE: K), we strive to enrich and delight the world through foods and brands that matter.

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.

            "DUBAI, UAE, April 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- ThreeFoldplans to integrate its peer-to-peer internet platform with three of the leading blockchain ecosystems in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space; Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Huobi's ECO Chain. ThreeFold is set to integrate BSC in the next couple of weeks, with Ethereum and Huobi's ECO Chain following shortly later on in Q2. These integrations will provide the ThreeFold ecosystem access to a wide array of DeFi applications. In turn, this will allow ThreeFold to be more accessible to the DeFi world and provide ThreeFold Farmers and users with more platforms to exchange TFT. ThreeFold's bold move comes while the wider cryptocurrency market is booming. The total value of all cryptocurrency-related or blockchain-based projects has surpassed $2.1 trillion in recent weeks, as market leaders, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, set new all-time highs. Accordingly, interest in blockchain technology is soaring as the number of active projects in the space nears 9,000. Moreover, in an environment in which internet use for all aspects of life is soaring owing to COVID-19 restrictions, ThreeFold's main value proposition- a truly peer-to-peer internet platform - is gaining traction. ThreeFold sees the sustainability of internet services in the long-run and its decentralization as inseparable. Democratizing the Internet But why is this needed? The internet today is hosted by a small group of well-resourced companies that are responsible for the maintenance of data centres which provide the server and storage space for the vast quantity of content on the internet. In addition, these same companies are finding a way to monopolize the network connections that allow data to flow around the globe. As a result, decisions made by these companies have the power to entirely change the landscape of the internet unilaterally, without contest. Given the fact that the internet is now integral to much of the world's industry, as well as many ways of life, the disproportionate power that these companies wield make them the de facto governors of the future of humanity's development. Just as Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned the democratization of the financial system through decentralization, ThreeFoldis on a similar quest to democratize the internet with a unique combination of autonomous and blockchain technology. The benefits would be clear. More internet users would benefit from a neutral peer-to-peer platform on which to store their data and run their applications privately and securely.Moreover, decentralization removes the internet's singular potential points of failure which could seriously disrupt the global Internet and Cloud industry. A Multichain Future ThreeFold's upcoming integration with BSC, Ethereum and Huobi's ECO Chain is a critical part of continuing to grow and cultivate the world's largest peer-to-peer internet platform. Ethereum is the number one platform for decentralized applications (dApps) in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space as of today. Accordingly, ThreeFold's platform will be put on the radar of the vast number of Ethereum users who could quite effortlessly become the much-needed nodes in its vision of a decentralized internet. Furthermore, there is a wealth of decentralized development expertise concentrated in the Ethereum-sphere, as well as in both Binance's and Huobi's blockchain ecosystems. In addition to improving compatibility with these platforms, ThreeFold will be able to tap into these development skills, inviting experienced dApp developers to build their applications on top of the ThreeFold Grid. Comparatively, ThreeFold's ambitious integration plans put it far ahead of similar projects in the decentralized internet space, who are traditionally Ethereum-based. However, with the increasing cost of Ethereum-based development and its slower than required scalability updates, ThreeFold's peer-to-peer Internet will remain affordable, scaleable and simple for developers. About ThreeFold ThreeFold is developing a peer-to-peer internet platform that aims to liberalize what it labels as a centralized and unequally distributed internet. Its platform, called the ThreeFold Grid, comprises over +600 servers in 25+ different countries around the world, delivering approximately 80 PB in storage and over 16,000 CPU cores worldwide, making it the largest storage and compute peer-to-peer internet network in the world. See ThreeFold Grid's statistics in more detail using their explorer here. Each server runs ThreeFold's stateless and lightweight open-source operating system, Zero-OS, and is set up and operated by independent individuals and organisations called Farmers. Farmers earn rewards in TFT- the platform's native token - for their participation. TFT is the currency of the ThreeFold Grid, with each token representing a unit of storage and compute on the platform. Grid users can use these tokens to reserve the storage and compute they need to store, build and share on the platform's internet network. ThreeFold's ultimate vision is to be part of the movement to fully democratize the internet worldwide. To learn more about how ThreeFold plans to democratize the internet, visit their website here.

Select pieces of the Americana branded uniform, which will be worn by every U.S. swimmer within the competition venue in Tokyo, go on sale for the holidays December 14. U.S. swim team Bishamon Collection kit designed by arena for Tokyo. U.S. swim team Bishamon Collection kit designed by arena for Tokyo. \"Arena has truly outdone themselves with the Bishamon Collection, not only creating stylish pieces for both our athletes and fans but so seamlessly marrying the rich tradition of the Japanese culture with the heart and soul of our team,\" USA Swimming Chief Commercial Officer Shana Ferguson said. \"We look forward to seeing these pieces on the world stage, as well as across the social realm from all the fans cheering us on at home.\" \"We are honored to be the Exclusive Outfitter of the United States national swim team. From the first days of our partnership, our primary objective was to fully integrate the USA National Team staff into our product development process to ensure that our National Team range wasn't just the best looking apparel on the global stage, but also met the demanding specifications of the world's best swim team,\" says Mark Pinger, General Manager for arena North America. Arena, the Exclusive Outfitter of the U.S. swim team since 2013, invoked the warrior spirit and divine favor of Japanese tradition in the launch of the Bishamon Collection. One of the Seven Gods of Fortune in Japanese folklore, Bishamon (or Bishamonten) is an armor-clad warrior god, a guardian deity who protects and brings divine favor in battle. He carries a spear in one hand and, in the other, a pagoda symbolizes a divine treasure house, whose contents he both guards and gives away. The USA Bishamon Collection honors this spirit, celebrating the fighter that exists in everyone, and supporting them with arena's distinctive armor so that they can be at their very best during the heat of the battle, whether it's in a global competition pool or a community center training session. For the collection's design, arena combined the Bishamon's warrior expression with the pattern of his armor, the Bishamon Kikko, inspired by the shell of a tortoise and representing longevity and good luck. The result is a design that symbolizes both protection and good fortune, with a singular ultimate goal: victory.The collection's available pieces, including hooded jackets, half zip shirts, tank tops, raglan t-shirts, Bermuda shorts, long tights, and men's and women's swimwear, can be viewed at www.usaswimming.org/tokyokit and purchased at www.arenasport.com.

            "NEW YORK, Feb. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --Out Leadership, the oldest and largest coalition of global companies working to improve LGBTQ+ equality in the world through the power of business, is launching its first ever Quorum Summit, a first-of-its-kind global talent and advocacy initiative focused on increasing LGBTQ+ representation on corporate boards. The four-day summit begins on Tuesday, February 2 and features key speakers from Quorum sponsors KPMG, Ropes & Gray, Goldman Sachs, Egon Zehnder International and from Out Leadership. \"For too long, LGBTQ+ inclusion has been overlooked and undervalued as a crucial part of diversity metrics on corporate boards. Out Leadership is changing that,\" said Out Leadership CEO and Founder Todd Sears. \"For the past seven years, we've been filling critical knowledge gaps to bring intersectional diversity to a new level through our Quorum initiative. We're proud of the momentum our work has created, especially in the last twelve months from California AB 979 to the Nasdaq's diversity proposal. Today's summit, and the ground-breaking research we're launching will hopefully take that momentum to the next levelaccessible to leaders and companies of all levels. The \"Visibility Counts: The LGBTQ+ Board Leadership Opportunity\" research report, which will be launched at the Quorum summit, is the first-ever research into LGBTQ+ board diversity. Published with Ropes & Gray, the research includes the first-ever LGBTQ+ Inclusive Board Diversity Report on the Fortune 500. It also contains tactical policy examples, best practices and seeks to expand the board diversity conversation globally to be LGBTQ+ inclusive. Key Findings from \"Visibility Counts: The LGBTQ+ Board Opportunity\" include: Only 24 out of 5,690 Director seats in the Fortune 500 are held by openly LGBTQ_ leaders, or 0.2% 88% of LGBTQ+ senior leaders surveyed said that this lack of representation directly resulted in LGBTQ+ leaders have been excluded from board opportunities. The seven main reasons for this lack of representation come down to: Lack of inclusion in diversity recruiting efforts, Perceived \"lack of demand\" among major search firms for LGBTQ+ board representation from their corporate clients, Perceived \"lack of offer\" for LGBTQ+ board representation, Gaps in data collection and reporting, Anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in policy and practice, Self-exclusion, and Low turnover and long tenure of board members \"Despite major progress on LGBTQ+ civil rights, as well as inclusion and visibility into the workforce of over 90% of the Fortune 500, the board room is still \"stuck in the closet\" when it comes to empowering LGBTQ+ out leaders and creating equal opportunities,\" continued Sears. \"The \"business case\" for board diversity was settled decades ago, but legacy structures continue to impede efforts to achieve the diversity of thought and perspective that growth-minded companies need to innovate. It's my hope that our summit and research will finally bring this to light, and show CEOs, board chairs and companies how many of these barriers to entry LGBTQ+ inclusive diversity can be solved by taking a proactive, policy based and data-reporting approach.\" Out Leadership's Quorum addresses LGBTQ+ board inclusion across three pillars: policy, talent and advocacy. The program offers board readiness trainings and seminars to executive leaders while also providing best practices and policy recommendations for companies looking for a place to start. Quorum works with pension funds, governments and companies around the world.

(the \"Company\") are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). To help readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; segment income; combined segment income and as adjusted revenue growth rates. The following measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; and segment income include gains and losses on investments held to fund the Company's obligations under employee deferred compensation plans. The Company provides these measures because they are used by management to review its operational results. Combined segment income is income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. The Company provides combined segment income because it is how the Company evaluates segment performance. Variations in the Company's financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, billing days, and certain intercompany adjustments. The Company provides \"as adjusted\" revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company's lines of business on both a reported basis and also on an as-adjusted basis for global, U.S. and international operations. This information is presented for each of the six most recent quarters. The Company has provided this data because it focuses on the Company's revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days, constant currency exchange rates, and certain intercompany adjustments. The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP.

Intersegment revenues for each line of business are aggregated and then eliminated as a single line item. The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table above adjust for the following items: Foreign Currency Translation.The \"As Reported\" revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues, which include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to calculate \"Constant Currency\" revenue growth rates, as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign exchange rates from the prior year's comparable period. Billing Days.The \"As Reported\" revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon inputs from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the company calculates \"same billing day\" revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period's reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a \"per billing day\" amount. The \"same billing day\" growth rates are then calculated based upon the \"per billing day\" amounts. Intercompany Adjustments. The \"As Reported\" revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by the impact of certain intercompany adjustments, applicable comparative period revenues are reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. The term \"As Adjusted\" means that the impact of different billing days, constant currency fluctuations, and certain intercompany adjustments are removed from the revenue growth rate calculation.

Sunoco intends to fund the tender offer, including accrued interest and fees and expenses payable in connection with the tender offer, with the net proceeds of its separately announced proposed offering of $500.0 million of debt securities (the \"debt financing\"), together with cash on hand. The tender offer is being made upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in Sunoco's Offer to Purchase dated November 9, 2020 (the \"Offer to Purchase\"). The tender offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on December 8, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by Sunoco (such time and date, the \"expiration date\"). Tenders of 2023 notes may be withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 23, 2020 (the \"withdrawal time\"), unless extended by Sunoco. 2023 notes tendered after the withdrawal time may not be withdrawn thereafter except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. Holders of 2023 notes are urged to carefully read the Offer to Purchase. Certain information regarding the 2023 notes and the terms of the tender offer is summarized in the table below. Per $1,000 Principal Amount Title of Security CUSIP Nos. Outstanding Principal Amount Tender Cap Tender Offer Consideration Early Tender Payment Total Consideration 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 86765LAH0/ U86759AE4/ 86765LAJ6 $1,000,000,000 $500,000,000 $987.50 $30.00 $1,017.50 Subject to the terms of the tender offer, holders who validly tender their 2023 notes (and do not validly withdraw their 2023 notes) prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 23, 2020, unless extended by Sunoco (such time and date, the \"early tender deadline\"), and whose 2023 notes are accepted for purchase, will be entitled to receive $1,017.50, payable in cash, for each $1,000 principal amount of 2023 notes accepted for payment (the \"total consideration\"), which amount includes an early tender payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount (the \"early tender payment\"). Holders who validly tender their 2023 notes after the early tender deadline but on or prior to the expiration date will be entitled to receive $987.50, payable in cash, for each $1,000 principal amount of 2023 notes accepted for purchase (the \"tender offer consideration\"). In addition to payments made for 2023 notes purchased, Sunoco will pay accrued and unpaid interest from the most recent interest payment date for the 2023 notes to, but not including, the applicable payment date for such 2023 notes accepted for purchase. 2023 notes accepted for purchase that are validly tendered prior to the early tender deadline are expected to receive payment on or shortly after November 24, 2020, but the date of such payment is subject to change without notice. 2023 notes accepted for purchase that are validly tendered after the early tender deadline but on or before the expiration date are expected to receive payment on or shortly after December 9, 2020, if necessary, but the date of such payment is subject to change without notice. If the purchase of all validly tendered 2023 notes would cause Sunoco to purchase a principal amount greater than the tender cap, then the tender offer will be oversubscribed and Sunoco, if it accepts 2023 notes in the tender offer, will accept for purchase tendered 2023 notes on a prorated basis as described in the Offer to Purchase. Furthermore, if the tender offer is fully subscribed as of the early tender deadline, holders who validly tender 2023 notes following the early tender deadline will not have any of their 2023 notes accepted for payment. Sunoco's obligation to consummate the tender offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the debt financing, which are more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. There can be no assurance such conditions will be satisfied. Sunoco reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to: (i) delay accepting 2023 notes, (ii) extend the early tender deadline, the withdrawal time or the expiration date, (iii) increase the tender cap, (iv) waive any and all conditions to the tender offer, (v) extend or terminate the tender offer at any time, or (vi) otherwise amend the tender offer in any respect. In the event that the debt financing is completed but the tender offer is not fully subscribed at an amount equal to the tender cap (as such tender cap may be increased or decreased) as of the expiration date, Sunoco intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the debt financing to redeem, subject to certain conditions, the 2023 notes in part (the \"redemption\"). Sunoco expects the redemption date (if it occurs) to be on or after January 15, 2020 at the then-applicable redemption price of 101.219% of such principal amount of the 2023 notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. 2023 notes acquired by Sunoco in the tender offer will be canceled and holders of such 2023 notes will not be entitled to any payment in connection with such future redemption.

            "AUSTIN, Texas, April 5, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- High Brew Coffee,the Austin-based leading maker of natural canned cold brew coffee, is expanding its Ready-to-Drink (RTD) line and continuing to innovate in the newly-introduced nitrogenated (nitro) cold brew category with the launch of its Sweet Cream Nitro Cold Brew variety. The company first entered the category in Spring 2020 with its initial Nitro Cold Brew Black flavor after having determined 65% of consumers were either 'interested' or 'very interested' in nitro cold brew. This latest extension was created based on overwhelming consumer feedback and interest. \"High Brew is a brand 'for those who do,'\" said David Smith, founder and CEO of High Brew Coffee. \"Our fans continue to crave nitro cold brew, and we are thrilled to be growing our nitro family with a new, Sweet Cream variety, which like our original offers natural caffeine, smooth taste and all the indulgence of a nitro latte.\" Nitro cold brew is resonating with the convenience consumer, and not just because it now comes in a can. High Brew Coffee uses industry-leading widget technology to infuse nitrogen into each of the brand's nitro products, so more nitrogen is released into the beverage than when using the infusion process. The in-can widget included in each of High Brew Coffee's nitro offerings injects nitrogen at the point of consumption, offering a more premium, fresh injection than many other similar products. Nitrogen bubbles are much smaller than normal carbonation bubbles, which creates a frothier, creamier cold brew. Additionally, nitro cold brew is less acidic than regular cold brew beverages and delivers a bold, less bitter taste than hot coffee. High Brew Coffee Sweet Cream Nitro is a better-for-you indulgence option with 200 milligrams of natural occurring caffeine. Like all High Brew Coffee products, this new nitro cold brew beverage ($3.69) is made from 100% Arabica, direct-trade beans, which are cold brewed over time, never heated. This new variety can be purchased online at www.highbrewcoffee.com as well as at select retailers, including Sprouts, Safeway, Albertsons, HEB and others. For more information on High Brew Coffee, visit www.highbrewcoffee.com. About High Brew CoffeeAfter working tirelessly for 13 years to turn his tiny tea company into a household name, David Smith, co-founder of Sweet Leaf Tea, embarked on the sailing adventure of a lifetime. Discovering the benefits of refreshing cold-brewed coffee during warm nights navigating rough waters, the idea for High Brew Coffeewas born. Founded in 2014, High Brew Coffee is an all-natural 100% Arabica blend ready-to-drink cold brew coffee made from Direct Trade coffee beans. Brewed with zero heat, High Brew Coffee offers premium low-calorie cold-brews in smooth, delicious flavors such as Double Espresso, Mexican Vanilla, Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate Mocha, Black & Bold, Creamy Cappuccino + Protein and more. Most recently, the brand launched its limited time self-heating cold brew can, powered by HeatGen, in its Black & Bold flavor. High Brew Coffee is shelf-stable to perfectly accompany an active and on-the-go lifestyle. For more information, please visit www.highbrewcoffee.com.

            "PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --Kodiak Sciences Inc. (Nasdaq: KOD), a biopharmaceutical company committed to researching, developing and commercializing transformative therapeutics to treat high prevalence retinal diseases, today reported business highlights and financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. \"We continue our strong execution in this second half of 2020,\" said Victor Perlroth, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Kodiak. \"Our DAZZLE study of KSI-301 in wet age-related macular degeneration has only a handful of patients left to enroll, and we are now enrolling GLEAM and GLIMMER in Diabetic Macular Edema and BEACON in Retinal Vein Occlusion. With over 300 retina specialists, clinical coordinators and staff having participated in our most recent Virtual Investigator Meeting, we are humbled and inspired by the receptivity and enthusiasm of the retina community for KSI-301 and its emerging clinical profile. These accomplishments, powered by our growing Kodiak team, bring us one step closer to a series of top-line data readouts beginning in early 2022. This 2022 Vision will, if successful, enable a single multi-indication BLA filing in 2022.\" Recent Business Highlights Upgraded Pivotal Study Program: We finalized the design of our KSI-301 pivotal study programs in RVO and DME and have launched all three studies. We are currently conducting two Phase 3 studies in DME (GLEAM and GLIMMER) to provide the mutually-confirmatory studies required by FDA for initial demonstration of safety and efficacy, one study in wet AMD (our ongoing DAZZLE study), and one study in RVO (BEACON). Each study protocol design has been optimized based on Phase 1b data and experience and will include the same treatment-nave patient populations as in the Phase 1b, as well as tighter dosing interval ranging, tighter disease control, and decreased subjectivity for retreatments, and each has high statistical power for non-inferiority (>90%). We also intend to initiate in early 2021 a Phase 3 study of KSI-301 in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (GLOW). DAZZLE Study Progress: We saw robust patient enrollment through the third quarter of 2020 and have completed U.S. patient recruitment into our DAZZLE pivotal study in wet AMD a potential reflection of the enthusiasm for KSI-301 on the part of clinical investigators and patients. EU patient enrollment commenced in June 2020 and we continue to see robust recruitment. We expect to complete overall DAZZLE study enrollment by year end 2020. With a one-year primary endpoint, we remain on track for a DAZZLE study top-line data readout in early 2022. As of November 4, 2020, over 545 of the planned 550 patients have been enrolled in DAZZLE. GLEAM / GLIMMER and BEACON Study Initiations: We initiated two Phase 3 studies in DME (GLEAM and GLIMMER) and one Phase 3 study in RVO (BEACON) in the third quarter of 2020. The randomization of treatment-nave patients into these three studies is a critical step to build the clinical evidence for KSI-301 as a safe, effective and highly durable therapy for patients with retinal diseases. The initiation of the additional Phase 3 studies and the robust patient recruitment into DAZZLE represent strong operational progress towards our 2022 Vision of a single BLA filed for KSI-301 in wet AMD, DME, and RVO in 2022. Continued maturation of Phase 1b Data: Updated safety and efficacy results from our ongoing Phase 1b trial of KSI-301 in patients with treatment nave wet AMD, DME, or RVO were presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists 2020 Virtual Annual Meeting in July 2020. We believe the data continue to support the \"anti-VEGF Generation 2.0\" profile of KSI-301. We intend to continue presenting data updates from the Phase 1b as the study progresses over its full three-year duration. Commercial Manufacturing Progress: We successfully negotiated a long-term agreement with Lonza for the manufacture of KSI-301. This agreement will provide Kodiak with a custom-built bioconjugation facility with a capacity to supply millions of doses per year.

About KSI-301 KSI-301 is an investigational anti-VEGF therapy built on the Kodiak's Antibody Biopolymer Conjugate (ABC) Platform and is designed to maintain potent and effective drug levels in ocular tissues for longer than existing agents. Kodiak's objective with KSI-301 is to develop a new first-line agent to improve outcomes for patients with retinal vascular diseases and to enable earlier treatment and prevention of vision loss for patients with diabetic eye disease. The Company's Phase 2b/3 DAZZLE pivotal study in patients with treatment-nave wet AMD was initiated in October 2019, and Kodiak initiated the Phase 3 GLEAM, GLIMMER, and BEACON pivotal studies of KSI-301 in diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion in September 2020. These studies are anticipated to form the basis of the Company's initial BLA to support potential approval and commercialization. An additional pivotal study in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is planned. Kodiak Sciences Inc. is developing KSI-301 and owns global rights to KSI-301. About the GLEAM and GLIMMER Studies in DME The Phase 3 GLEAM and GLIMMER studies are global, multi-center, randomized studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, durability and safety of KSI-301 in patients with treatment-nave diabetic macular edema (DME). In each study, patients are randomized to receive either intravitreal KSI-301 on an individualized dosing regimen every eight to 24 weeks after only three loading doses or intravitreal aflibercept every eight weeks after five loading doses per its label. Each study is expected to enroll approximately 450 patients worldwide. The primary endpoint for both studies is the change from baseline in best-corrected vision at one year, and patients will be treated and followed for two years. Additional information about the GLEAM study (also called Study KS301P104) and the GLIMMER study (also called Study KS301P105) can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov under Trial Identifiers NCT04611152 and NCT04603937, respectively (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04611152 and https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04603937). About the BEACON Study in RVO The Phase 3 BEACON study is a global, multi-center, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy, durability and safety of KSI-301 in patients with treatment-nave macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO), including both branch and central subtypes. Patients are randomized to receive either intravitreal KSI-301 every eight weeks after only two loading doses or monthly intravitreal aflibercept per its label, for the first six months. In the second six months, patients in both groups will receive treatment on an individualized basis per protocol-specified criteria. The study is expected to enroll approximately 550 patients worldwide. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in best-corrected vision at six months, and patients will be treated and followed for one year. Additional information about the BEACON study (also called Study KS301P103) can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov under Trial Identifier NCT04592419 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04592419). About the DAZZLE Study in Wet AMD The Phase 2b/3 DAZZLE study is a global, multi-center, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy, durability and safety of KSI-301 in patients with treatment-nave wet AMD. Patients are randomized to receive either KSI-301 on an individualized dosing regimen as infrequently as every five months and no more often than every three months or to receive aflibercept on its labeled every eight-week dosing regimen, each after three monthly initiating doses. The study is expected to enroll approximately 550 patients worldwide. The primary endpoint is at one year and each patient will be treated and followed for two years. Additional information about DAZZLE (also called Study KSI-CL-102) can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov under Trial Identifier NCT04049266 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04049266). About the KSI-301 Clinical Program The KSI-301 Clinical Program is designed to assess KSI-301's safety, efficacy and durability in wet AMD, DME, RVO and non-proliferative DR (without DME) through clinical studies run in parallel. We are conducting two Phase 3 studies in DME (the GLEAM and GLIMMER studies) to provide the mutually confirmatory studies required by FDA for initial demonstration of safety and efficacy. We also are conducting one study in wet AMD (our ongoing DAZZLE study) and one study in RVO (the BEACON study) to support approval in these indications. We intend to file this package together in a single BLA in 2022. We also plan to run an additional study in patients with non-proliferative DR without DME (the GLOW study). We expect that the global KSI-301 clinical program will be conducted at 150+ study sites in more than 10 countries. About Kodiak Sciences Inc.

            "NEW YORK, Feb. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --The Conference Board Employment Trends Index (ETI) increased in January, the ninth consecutive monthly increase since May of last year. The index now stands at 99.27, up from 98.55 (a downward revision) in December. The index is currently down 10.0 percent from a year ago. \"The Employment Trends Index has been increasing in recent months, with the largest contributing component being the number of jobs in the temporary help industry. Over the next few months, expect some uncertainty around job growth, especially if some potentially adverse COVID-19 developments manifest namely, the rapid spread of more aggressive virus strains. On the upside, however, by spring we expect strong job growth to resume and continue throughout the remainder of the year,\" said Gad Levanon, Head of The Conference Board Labor Markets Institute. \"By late spring, we expect that the number of new infections will be significantly lower due to the rollout of vaccinations, possibly prompting businesses to start adding jobs again at an accelerated pace. Most of the job gains are expected in in-person services such as restaurants, hotels, recreation, passenger transportation, and childcare services. Between now and the end of the year, the unemployment rate could drop to about 5 percent.\" January's increase was driven by positive contributions from five of the eight components. From the largest positive contributor to the smallest, the components were: Number of Employees Hired by the Temporary-Help Industry; Ratio of Involuntarily Part-time to All Part-time Workers; Industrial Production; Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now; and Job Openings. The Employment Trends Index is a leading composite index for employment. Turning points in the index indicate that a turning point in employment is about to occur in the coming months. The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight leading indicators of employment, each of which has proven accurate in its own area. Aggregating individual indicators into a composite index filters out \"noise\" to show underlying trends more clearly. The eight leading indicators of employment aggregated into the Employment Trends Index include: Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find \"Jobs Hard to Get\" (The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey) Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance (U.S. Department of Labor) Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now ( National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation) Number of Employees Hired by the Temporary-Help Industry (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) Ratio of Involuntarily Part-time to All Part-time Workers (BLS) Job Openings (BLS)** Industrial Production (Federal Reserve Board)* Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)** *Statistical imputation for the recent month **Statistical imputation for two most recent months The Conference Board publishes the Employment Trends Index monthly, at 10 a.m. ET, on the Monday that follows each Friday release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Situation report.

(OTCQB: IWSY), a leader in biometric identification and authentication, today announced it has closed a $2,187,000 senior secured bridge loan, representing an advance against investor commitments to purchase $10,935,000 in Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in a proposed private placement. The bridge loan matures on the six-month anniversary of the loan and bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum.Upon closing of the private placement of Series D Preferred, all principal and accrued interest under the terms of the bridge loan will be converted into shares of Series D Preferred. The bridge loan is secured by all present after-acquired assets of the Company.Proceeds from the bridge loan will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. Kristin A. Taylor, President and CEO, said, \"This strategic financing, anchored by funds and accounts managed by Nantahala Capital Management, LLC, supports ImageWare's plan for substantial growth. We continue our focus of evolving ImageWare into a \"biometrics first\" identity company. Our biometric solutions enable Governments, Public Services, and Enterprises to transform how they use identity to build trust with their employees, partners, and customers, sell their products, and deliver their services. We revolutionize traditional security models - providing critical identity infrastructure, biometrically verified - to drive effective employee and customer on-boarding, verification, authentication, and access solutions, while giving the customer full control of their data across a wide range of devices and readers. We are targeting not only more public sector projects (including state/local/federal law enforcement and public safety, as well as national identity), but we are also carving out an improved Enterprise offering. \"We are grateful to the institutional investors and existing shareholders who believe in our organized new business plan and talented management team,\" continued Taylor. \"The successful Series D Preferred commitments come on the heels of revenue from an existing contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide smart badge technology and a new contract for professional services to expand user functionality, valued at $1.2 million. \"These developments are in addition to our focus on rationalizing our products and our operating expenses where we have eliminated legacy products that were not generating revenue, and reduced expenses that were weighing the business down. As a result of our renewed focus, we are seeing measurable growth of our law enforcement software and intend to aggressively go after more international markets in the public safety sector in the coming year,\" concluded Taylor. Series D Preferred Financing The private placement of Series D Preferred is expected to close in approximately thirty days resulting in a minimum of $10 million and a maximum of $15 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to closing. Organizational Restructuring The Series D Preferred financing marks the beginning of many proposed pivotal changes intended to increase shareholder value, including: A restructuring of the Company's Board of Directors, leaving only Kristin A. Taylor, President and CEO on the Board, with four new members anticipated to join upon closing of the Series D Preferred financing; A plan to list the Company's Common Stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market; A strategic initiative to monetize the Company's intellectual property with the objective of driving incremental revenue through licensing its deep portfolio of IP.

            "LAS VEGAS, Jan. 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --William Hill, America's leading Sports Betting Company, will be opening prop wagering around 2PM PT today for Super Bowl 55 at its 100+ William Hill Sports Books across America and on its Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. sports betting apps. With the addition of props (LINK to Prop Packet), bettors have 1,218 different ways to bet next Sunday's Championship game. William Hill will also be offering continuous LIVE InPlay wagering (Point Spreads, Totals, and Money Lines) throughout Super Bowl 55. A full list of locations and details can be found at www.williamhill.com/us . The Kansas City Chiefs are 3-point favorites versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at William Hill and the total (over/under) is 56.5. The current Money Line is Kansas City -165 and Tampa Bay is +145. An Inside Look Behind the Making of William Hill's Super Bowl 55 Props It's Sunday night, and the Chiefs are closing out a 38-24 victory over the Bills in the AFC Championship. The Super Bowl 55 matchup has been set. And for Adam Pullen, Assistant Director of Trading for William Hill U.S., the most grueling four-day stretch of the year has begun. Pullen starts compiling all of the team and player statistics for both the Chiefs and Buccaneers, regular season and postseason. On Monday, it's an all-day grind of manually setting up every Super Bowl prop betting market into William Hill's system. Then it's time to set the odds. Since William Hill's inception in 2012, Pullen and Director of Trading Nick Bogdanovich have been the two-man unit behind thousands of Super Bowl props. It's a little different this year with the COVID-19 pandemic, as Pullen has been working from home versus being face-to-face with Bogdanovich going over everything in the office together. \"This is definitely the toughest few days of the job, just because of the time crunch,\" Pullen said. \"Last week for the AFC and NFC Championships, we had like 30-something props for each game. Now we have maybe like 300? It's a big jump compared to the normal routine. It's not an incremental build-up, it's like bam! But I enjoy it, it's a great matchup and it figures to be a good game. There's a lot of legwork that goes into doing it, but this is the biggest sporting event in our country, so it is what it is. There's a lot of attention thrown at it, and rightfully so.\" After plugging in their respective numbers on index props such as first touchdown scorer on Monday night, the bulk of the work this year is done on Tuesday. Bogdanovich and Pullen discuss everything from player yardage to the distance of the first field goal made to the number of plays on the first touchdown drive of the game. But what happens if there's disagreement between the two on a certain prop? \"Nick's got a really good mind as far as looking into the nuts and bolts of the game and the matchup,\" Pullen said. \"We work well together. Occasionally you're going to have those differences, but we just end up meeting in the middle. I wish I could say it's some type of rocket science, but it's not. If I make something -120 and he makes it -200, it's as easy as making it -160. It's not saying to one another 'you're wrong.' You don't really have any time to discuss and get super in-depth with everything because of how much there is. We just come to a good common ground and we have that trust with each other.\" On Tuesday night and Wednesday, a good chunk of the workload is proofreading the sheets for the packet and making sure everything is clear as can be to bettors regarding all the stipulations for the prop bets listed. More complex offerings such as cross-sport props are among the last to be finished. Then, after Bogdanovich and Pullen re-check everything, this year's William Hill Super Bowl props are set to be submitted before the noon PST deadline on Thursday. Yet, despite decades of experience under their belts, there are still some markets that are trickier for them to create than others for Super Bowl 55. \"It was difficult to make the running back props this year,\" Bogdanovich said. \"Darrel Williams has emerged, [Clyde] Edwards-Helaire will be healthy. Those two were really hard to make. [Leonard] Fournette has looked great in the playoffs, but [Ronald] Jones will be healthier as well. Jones was the man before he got hurt. The stars will be straightforward for making the props, it's the fringe players where it got tricky. \"The health of [Antonio] Brown is going to determine the amount of touches that [Scotty Miller and Tyler Johnson] get. We know [Mike] Evans and [Chris] Godwin will get theirs, but the Brown situation definitely impacts everyone else for sure. The Bucs have a bunch of tight ends too, we had to figure it out for [Rob] Gronkowski and [Cameron] Brate too. I think the Bucs will have to stay aggressive to keep up with Kansas City, so I think you'll see Brady throwing a lot.\" Even though it may be more difficult to figure out the odds for lesser offensive players, the biggest names still deserve a good amount of attention too. Stars have been crushing their overs on props so far this postseason, particularly for Kansas City. Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce have both crossed the 100-yard mark in each of the Chiefs' playoff contests. \"We just look at the stats and we bounce them off each other,\" Pullen said. \"He'd say Mike Evans, 'I like 65 [receiving yards]' and I'll say that I like 68. Then we put up 67 or 67.5. That's how it is a lot. We discuss certain things, like knowing that we're going to get so much public money on the over. So how much do we want to shade to the public, because as much as you respect the pros, the public money is huge. We're going to have decisions like we've never seen before.\" SOURCE William Hill\n",

            "KINGSTON, Jamaica, Dec. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --Digicel Group Holdings Limited, formerly known as Digicel Group 0.5 Limited (\"Digicel,\" the \"Company\", \"we\" or \"us\"), today announced that it is extending the Early Tender Date (as defined in the Company's Offer to Purchase dated November 19, 2020 (the \"Offer to Purchase\")), related to its cash tender offer (the \"Offer\"), for its outstanding 7.00% PIK Perpetual Convertible Notes (the \"Notes\"). The Early Tender Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) is extended to 11:59p.m., New York City time, on December 17, 2020. Accordingly, the Early Tender Date is now the same as the Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) and any holder that validly tenders Notes prior to the Expiration Date and has its Notes accepted will be eligible to receive the Total Consideration (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), which includes the Early Tender Payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, for Notes accepted for purchase in the Offer. The \"Total Consideration\" per $1,000 principal amount of Notes payable to holders who validly tender (and do not withdraw) their Notes on or prior to the Early Tender Date will be equal to a Clearing Price to be determined pursuant to a \"modified Dutch Auction\" procedure as described below. Each holder that tenders Notes in the Offer may specify a \"Bid Price\" within a range between $200 and $240 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents the minimum Total Consideration such holder is willing to receive for those Notes. Each Bid Price must be in increments of $2.50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Each holder that wishes to receive the Clearing Price (as defined below) and that does not wish to express a minimum purchase price (a \"Non-Competitive Bid\") need not specify a Bid Price. Non-Competitive Bids will be treated as if they were submitted with a Bid Price equal to $200 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. The Total Consideration will equal the Clearing Price. The \"Clearing Price\" will be determined based on the Bid Price of all tendered Notes on or prior to the Expiration Date, in order of lowest to highest Bid Price specified or deemed to have been specified by tendering holders (including any holders that elect to enter a Non-Competitive Bid). The Clearing Price will be the single lowest Bid Price so specified that will enable the Company to spend all or as close as possible to all of the Tender Cap (as defined in the Offer to Purchase). We will pay the same Total Consideration for all Notes tendered with Bid Prices at or below the Clearing Price and accepted for purchase in the Offer. Accordingly, any holders of Notes whose Notes are accepted in the Offer will receive no less than the Bid Price specified by such holder of Notes (or deemed to be specified). For the avoidance of doubt, the Withdrawal Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) has not been extended and remains at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 3, 2020. Now that the Withdrawal Date has passed, holders may no longer withdraw Notes tendered in the Offer, except in certain limited circumstances as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. Questions regarding the Offer may be directed to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at Attn: Liability Management Group, (800) 558-3745 (toll-free), (212) 723-6106 (collect). Requests for documents may be directed to Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the information agent for the Offer, at (212) 430-3774 (collect) or at (866) 470-4700 (toll-free). None of the Company, the dealer manager or the information agent make any recommendations as to whether holders should tender their Notes pursuant to the Offer, and no one has been authorized by any of them to make such recommendations. Holders must make their own decisions as to whether to tender their Notes, and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender. No Offer or Solicitation This press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to purchase, a solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell the Notes or any other securities or a solicitation of consent with respect to the Notes or any other securities, nor shall there be any purchase of our Notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or purchase would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The Offer is being made solely pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, which sets forth the complete terms of the Offer. Forward Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements.
